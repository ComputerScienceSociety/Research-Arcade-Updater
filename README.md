# Research-Arcade-Updater
 A WPF App for the University of Lincoln Research Arcade Machines.
## Setup
  Edit the Config.json file to your liking, the template file looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "LauncherURL": "",
    "LauncherVersionURL": ""
  }
  ```
  If you leave it this way, it will probably crash, I didn't test it because I'm a professional.
## Information
  This is the Updater for [Research-Arcade-Launcher](https://github.com/Malphatt/Research-Arcade-Launcher "GitHub.com").
  Refer to the docs for help.
